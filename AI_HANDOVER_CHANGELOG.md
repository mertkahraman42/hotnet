  - Added class-level documentation to `GameScreen` and `BaseUnit`
  - Created detailed README.md with game overview and technical details
  - Added inline comments explaining key functionality

- Fixed unit movement and combat mechanics
  - Normalized delta time in game loop for consistent movement speeds
  - Adjusted unit base speeds for better gameplay balance
  - Implemented proper unit targeting and combat behavior
  - Added health bars and visual feedback for unit states

- Enhanced game UI and visual elements
  - Implemented cyberpunk-themed grid background
  - Added glowing center point effect
  - Created octagonal map with player sections

  - Improved position labels and castle marker

### Current State
The game is in a stable state with core functionality working:
- 2-4 player multiplayer support
- Unit spawning and movement
- Combat mechanics
- Visual feedback
- Faction selection

### Last Work In Progress
We were working on:
1. Unit speed balancing
   - Recent changes to normalize movement speeds
   - Need to fine-tune base speeds for different unit types
   - Consider adding speed modifiers for different factions

2. Documentation
   - Added comprehensive documentation
   - Need to maintain and update as new features are added
   - Consider adding API documentation for key interfaces

### Useful Information for Continued Development
1. Unit Movement System
   - Movement speed is now normalized using delta time (delta/60)
   - Base speeds in `BASE_UNIT_STATS` can be adjusted
   - Units automatically path towards center with small random offsets

2. Combat System
   - Units automatically target nearest enemies
   - Damage variance is implemented per unit type
   - Health bars update in real-time
   - Dead units are removed after 1-second delay

3. Visual System
   - Z-index hierarchy is documented in `GameScreen.tsx`
   - Unit shapes are defined in `BaseUnit.ts`
   - Color coding follows player index (1-4)

4. Known Areas for Improvement
   - Unit collision avoidance could be enhanced
   - Ranged unit targeting could be more sophisticated
   - Support unit abilities need implementation
   - Victory conditions need to be defined

### Next Steps
1. Implement support unit abilities (healing, buffs)
2. Add victory conditions and game state management
3. Enhance unit AI for better tactical behavior
4. Add sound effects and additional visual feedback
5. Implement player statistics and achievements
